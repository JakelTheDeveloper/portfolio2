                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>My name is Ja'Kel Jenkins and I'm from Wilson, NC! I'm
                    a very laid back and observative person. I love to tackle
                    new challenges as this increases my confidence in my abilities.
                    I've been programming Flash games since I was 12 years
                    old.</p>
                    <p> I've always wanted to have my own video game studio and
                    to build my own game console to play my games on. I want to 
                    combine my full stack web development knowledge with my current 
                    programming skills to create something refreshing!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class='group'>
            <div class="item">
                <p>When I was 8 years old, I developed a keen interest in computers
                    and how they work. I was particularly interested in game development
                    and AI. I would love to form a team with my classmates and work on a 
                    project collectively. I think that this would be very fun and would be
                    a good way to learn team work and new concepts from one another.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of coding, I love to make music, draw, play golf, and basketball.
                    I've currently made 10 mixtapes that can be found on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cloudkel" target = "_blank">SoundCloud.</a>
                    I have 2 kids, Kalen and Kaleena. They are very loving and energetic kids
                    and always give me a daily reminder of the joys of life.
                </p>
